# TMS Smart Setup definition file for Example
# Do not modify this file. To configure smart setup, edit tms.config.yaml instead.
minimum required tmsbuild version: 1.0
  
application:
  id: tms.example # use a short descriptive name in the form company.product. This id will be used everywhere by tms smart setup to refer to this product.
  name: TMS Example for VCL

    dependencies:
      - tms.product2   # a weak dependency. packages using this framework will only be compiled if tms.product2 exists
      - ~tms.product3 # when a dependency starts with ~, it means "NOT". That is, the framework will be active is tms.product3 is NOT installed.

packages:
  - Example_Core: [runtime, vcl, fmx]

paths:
  extra library paths:  #include only paths not in the files in the dpr. You can add them to a platform only by writing for example - @platform: path
    
    # - path1 # relative to the root of the project. do not start with a \. You can also use /, tmsbuild will fix it according ot the OS.
    # - path2\a\b
    # - @linux64,win64intel: path3 #only added to the linux64 and win64 library path
  
  extra browsing paths:
  
  extra debug dcu path:

  web core paths: #paths to register in webcore
    # - path1

  # the paths below are pattern-matched with the existing library path (case insensitive), and they will be passed to the compiler if they match.
  # Smart setup by default doesn't pass the library path in the user's machine to the compiler, to avoid errors due to broken
  # library paths. Use this only when you need some component like fmxlinux which is not a smart-setup dependency and not something that comes built-in in delphi.
  search paths to preserve:
    # - *fmxlinux*


defines:
    defines filename: source/example.inc # if not empty, smart setup will create this file and overwrite any existing file. You can include this file from other include file.
                                         # the folder mus exist. You can use both / or \ as path separator, smart setup will fix it for the os. The folder must exist.
    available defines:  # this are the defines the user can write in the "defines" section of tmsbuild.config.yaml.  
      - RTTI  # this option will make your compiled exes much bigger. Only set it to true if requires, and likely in a product-by product basis.
      - USE_UNICODE

# Add entries to HKCU. You can use the variables %product-id%, %install-path%, %install-date%, %install-time%, %version%, %alternate-registry-key%
# %alternate-registry-key% is what the "alternate registry key" used by delphi, as specified in tms.config.yaml
# value type can be String or DWORD. If ommited it is String

  # if "A" depends on "B" and "B" on "C", you can just write "B" as the "A" dependency. 
  # You can also write "C" and it will still work, but it is not necessary. Only direct dependencies are needed.
