      - ~tms.product3 # when a dependency starts with ~, it means "NOT". That is, the framework will be active is tms.product3 is NOT installed.

packages:

  - FMX_Example: [runtime, fmx]

# The settings in the this section are only needed if the packages don't follow smartsetup conventions
package options:
  # By default, smartsetup double-checks that the dproj it is going to compile supports the platforms you specified above in the "packages" section.
  # But some packages might have wrong data in the dproj. If you set this to true, smartsetup will ignore whatever the dproj says and only use the info in "packages" 
  ignore dproj platforms: false

  # This shouldn't be needed in general. Smartsetup will find your packages wherever they are.
  # But sometimes you might have the same packages in different unrelated folders (maybe some backup) and SmartSetup will get confused
  # about which ones it has to use. In this case, you can specify the relative path here where SmartSetup will start looking for packages.
  root package folder:

  # Use this *only* when you cannot change the packages. If possible, it is always better to modify the packages
  # so they have a libsuffix. Otherwise, manual compilation of the packages will fail.
  # add libsuffix: true

  # Use this section only if you are not using the standard smartsetup folders for the packages.
  # Note that if the same folder supports for example Delphi 11 and Delphi 12 (by using Libsuffix $(auto)), you can 
  # write the same folder for 11 and 12.
  # You can also use a + at the end of the IDE Name to specify that this applies to that Delphi version and all newer ones.
  # When using + order is important. In the example above, the line with delphisydney+ affects all versions until delphi12 (sydney and 11).
  # The line delphi12+, being below delphisydney+ affects all delphi versions after 12, overriding the line delpihsydney+.
  # If you don't specify a name for a given version,  the standard packages will be assumed for that version.
  package folders:
  #  delphirio: Rad Studio 10.3 Rio
  #  delphisydney+: Rad Studio Sydney To 11
  #  delphi12+: Rad Studio 12 And Newer

  # If the packages in the library use LIBSUFFIX different from the standard (270, 280, etc), you need to specify them here.
  # In most cases, you should just have standard LIBSUFIXes and do nothing here.
  # This setting applies to all packages in the library.
  lib suffixes:
  # delphi11: _D11
  # delphi12: _D12

  # Use this section if you require a different set of defines to compile from SmartSetup
  # Avoid using this section whenever possible, the best is to modify the packages to have the correct includes
  extra defines:
  #  - add: MYDEFINE
  #  - remove: OTHERDEFINE  


# Only include this section if the library doesn't provide its own packages, or those are unusable. In that case, we will create them with the definitions below.
# Note: This section must come after you have specified the "packages" section above.
package definitions:
#  Example_Core:
#    framework type: NONE # can be NONE, FMX or VCL
#    description: description for the package
#    requires: rtl;dbrtl;FireDAC   #write the dcp packages this package requires. don't include the dcp extension.
#    files:
#      - source:
#          folder: source\core;  # Include the files in the folder.
#          include file mask: '*'                  # separate masks with ;.
#          exclude file mask: '*.dcu'
#      - source:
#          folder: source\advanced;  # Include the files in the folder.
#          include folder mask: source     # for recursive calls, we will only enter folders named source  
#          exclude folder mask: .svn       # for recursive calls, we will exclude folders names .svn.
#          include file mask: '*.pas;*.rc'                  # separate masks with ;.
#          recursive: true #search in subfolders also. false by default

# Only applies to executables.
exe options:
  # You might want to build an exe with just one delphi version, not all of them.
  # The possible values here are "latest" (use the latest delphi version supported and installed in the user's machine), "earliest" and "all" (compile in all delphi versions
  # supported in the user's machine). The default if omitted is "all"
  compile with: latest

  # If false, do not generate debug version of the exes even if the user is building with debug dcus. Default is false.
  debug exes: false

paths:
  extra library paths:  #include only paths not in the files in the dpr. You can add them to a platform only by writing for example - @platform: path
    
    # - path1 # relative to the root of the project. do not start with a \. You can also use /, tmsbuild will fix it according ot the OS.
    # - path2\a\b
    # - @linux64,win64intel: path3 #only added to the linux64 and win64 library path
  
  extra browsing paths:
  
  extra debug dcu path:

  web core paths: #paths to register in webcore
    # - path1

  # the paths below are pattern-matched with the existing library path (case insensitive), and they will be passed to the compiler if they match.
  # Smart setup by default doesn't pass the library path in the user's machine to the compiler, to avoid errors due to broken
  # library paths. Use this only when you need some component like fmxlinux which is not a smart-setup dependency and not something that comes built-in in delphi.
  search paths to preserve:
    # - *fmxlinux*

  # this is similar to "extra library paths" above (and all the comments also apply here), but this path will only be added when compiling
  # with msbuild. "extra library paths" will be added when compiling with msbuild, but also registered in Rad Studio. Entries here won't be registered.
  # normally you will use this entries to fix buggy packages that you can't modify. It shouldn't be needed in normal cases and correct packages.
  build-only library paths:
  # - source

defines:
    defines filename: source/example.inc # if not empty, smart setup will create this file and overwrite any existing file. You can include this file from other include file.
                                         # the folder must exist. You can use both / or \ as path separator, smart setup will fix it for the os. The folder must exist.
    available defines:  # this are the defines the user can write in the "defines" section of tmsbuild.config.yaml.  
      - RTTI  # this option will make your compiled exes much bigger. Only set it to true if requires, and likely in a product-by product basis.
      - USE_UNICODE

# Add entries to HKCU. For the values, you can use the variables %product-id%, %install-path%, %install-date%, %install-time%, %version%, %alternate-registry-key%
# %alternate-registry-key% is what the "alternate registry key" used by delphi, as specified in tms.config.yaml
# value type can be String or DWORD. If omitted it is String
# For the Keys, you can use the variable %bds% to access the registry path for the BDS install.
