tms smart setup options:

  # 0 means use the optimum for the cores in the machine (default). 1 means single core. 2 two cores and so on.
  build cores: %build-cores%

  # installs the component in an alternate place so you can have different components installed in the same Delphi.
  # see https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9290131/starting-delphi-with-an-alternate-registry-key
  alternate registry key: %alternate-registry-key%

  # prevents the machine from going to sleep while smart setup is running. Default is true.
  # note that for this setting to work, "Allow applications to prevent automatic sleep (plugged in)" must be set
  # to Enabled in the Group Policy Settings. See https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys/issues/12326#issuecomment-1304934080
  prevent sleep: %prevent-sleep%

  # smart setup will delete the oldest downloaded versions when they reach this count. If you
  # for example set this value to 4, smart setup will keep the last 4 versions of each product, and 
  # versions older than that will be deleted forever. 
  # A value of 0 means to delete all products after unzipped, including the current versions.
  # A value of -1 means to keep all versions and never delete any.
  versions to keep: %versions-to-keep%

  # the default behavior of smart setup is to skip Delphi versions and platforms that are not installed.
  # this is normally what you want, so you don't have to manually specify in this file which platforms and Delphi versions
  # to compile. You just leave it to compile all, and smart setup will skip what is not installed.
  # but when running smart setup from a CI or other automated system, you might want to configure exactly what
  # platforms and Delphi IDEs you want to build, and have smart setup return an error code instead of just skipping them.
  # if you set this property true, smart setup will return an error value if it skips any Delphi version or platform.
  error if skipped: %error-if-skipped%

  # By default, tms looks for tmsbuild.yaml in folders under the folder where this file is. But you can add additional
  # root folders here, so tms also looks for tmsbuild.yaml files in those folders.
  # All configuration folders (.tmsbuild, Temp, etc) are still under the main root folder, nothing will
  # be generated under the additional folders. This is useful if you want to use tms to build your own code.
  # The folders you add here must be in the same drive as the main root folder.
