# Creating SmartSetup bundles

SmartSetup is designed to compile and install any package or application, not only tms-created packages. Adding SmartSetup support to your own components and applications will let you use them as dependencies in the build system, and make them available to others. You will also be able to compile full applications without registering their dependencies in Rad Studio.

## SmartSetup bundle composition

A SmartSetup bundle is just a folder with the files you need inside, together with a `tmsbuild.yaml` file at the root. The folder might be compressed (we currently support **zip** and **tar.zstd** compression), or it might be just a folder with files. The `tmsbuild.yaml` file is used to configure how SmartSetup will compile the bundle. 

* Zip files are preferred for distributing source code to many users. Zip is the most common compression method, and everyone can easily unzip the bundles to see the files inside.

* Tar.zstd files are preferred for distributing bundles that have big binary files inside (like a trial or a pre-compiled bundle). [Zstd](https://facebook.github.io/zstd/) is a newer compression method that can compress much more than zip, and is much faster at similar compression levels. Windows 11 also has direct support for looking at `.tar.zstd` files directly in Windows Explorer, so there is no need for users to install any additional tool if they want to uncompress the bundle manually. And virtually any modern third-party compression tool supports them too.

* Source folders are preferred for development, and also if you are sharing a component directly from a GIT/SVN repository. 

## Structure for library packages

There are some few requirements for the packages SmartSetup can work with:

1. SmartSetup requires packages; it isn’t designed to work with “source only” distributions. But if you don’t have them, SmartSetup can create them for you. See the [package definitions section.](#package-definitions-section) 

2. All packages must be in the same root folder, inside another folder with the Rad Studio version (`package root\delphi version`). So, for example, you might have your Delphi 12 packages in `\packages\d12` and your Delphi 13 packages in `\packages\d13`. You might also have them in `\my packages\delphi\Rad Studio 12 Athens` and `\my packages\delphi\Rad Studio 13 Florence`. What you can’t have is, for example, `\packages\delphi\delphi12` and `\packages\lazarus`. You need a single package root, and then all Delphi/Lazarus packages should be inside a single folder.

3. All packages for different Delphi versions must have the same name, and must have a [{$LIBSUFFIX}](https://docwiki.embarcadero.com/RADStudio/en/Compiler_directives_for_libraries_or_shared_objects_%28Delphi%29) directive inside too.  
In Smart Setup, you can use any LIBSUFFIX you want (although the standard 280, 290, … naming needs less configuration), and also  `{$LIBSUFFIX AUTO}` for Delphi 11 and newer. But you need to have a LIBSUFFIX.

### Standard SmartSetup naming

While you can use any naming convention you want, if you are starting a library from scratch and want to follow SmartSetup conventions, the packages should all be inside folders named `<root>\packages\<version>`. Where `<version>` is any of:

 * lazarus, d6, d7, d2005, d2006, d2007, d2009, d2010,
 * dxe, dxe2, dxe3, dxe4, dxe5, dxe6, dxe7, dxe8
 * dseattle, dberlin, dtokyo, drio, dsydney
 * d11, d12, d13

{{#Note}}

If your package has {$LIBSUFFIX AUTO} and it supports multiple Delphi versions, you can append a “+” after any of the names above to show that this is the folder for that version and all newer versions, until the next “+” folder. For example, you might have:

 * `packages\drio`

 * `packages\dsydney`

 * `packages\d11+`

And the “d11+” folder will be used for all Delphi versions after and including Delphi11. If in the future, say Delphi 2048 introduces a breaking change in the packages and you need a new package for them, you can add a line:

 * `packages\d2048+`

With this extra line, all packages \>= Delphi 11 but \<Delphi 2048 will use the d11+ folder. All packages \>= Delphi 2048 will use the d2048 folder.
See [this section for more information](#supporting-multiple-delphi-versions-with-the-same-package).

{{/Note}}

If your packages have a different naming convention, it is likely that we can still compile them, as long as they match the requirements above. But you will have to tell SmartSetup manually where they are, using the file `tmsbuild.yaml`

## Structure for applications

SmartSetup can also compile applications, not just packages. For applications, the only restriction is:

1. You can have a single application per product. 

If you need to compile multiple applications, each one must go in its own product, with its own `tmsbuild.yaml`. Other than that, they might be anywhere below the root folder, and there is nothing you need to do for SmartSetup to find them. 

## Creating a tmsbuild.yaml file

Once you have all the files you want to deploy in a folder, with the packages in the correct places, you will need to create a `tmsbuild.yaml` file at the root.

You can get a commented, up-to-date example with all the properties here: https://github.com/tmssoftware/smartsetup/blob/main/tms/example-config/tmsbuild.yaml

And you can also look at the [SmartSetup registry](https://github.com/tmssoftware/smartsetup-registry/tree/main) to see actual files for actual projects that SmartSetup supports.

{{#Important}}
While we [don't recommend that you add your own comments to `tms.config.yaml`](xref:SmartSetup.Configuration), here the opposite is true. `tmsbuild.yaml` will not be regenerated, so you can comment it properly.
{{/Important}}

The sections of the file `tmsbuild.yaml` are discussed below.

{{#Note}}

If you follow standard naming for your folders and libsuffixes, the `tmsbuild.yaml` file can be very simple. You can see an example here: [Landgraf AWS SDK for Delphi](https://github.com/tmssoftware/smartsetup-registry/blob/main/landgraf.aws.sdk/tmsbuild.yaml)

{{/Note}}

### **application** section

Here, you just need to provide basic information about the package. It is recommended that you have a file “version.txt” at the root of your bundle, where SmartSetup can read the version number. This version number will be used in many places, so you should have tools to update it automatically.

### **supported frameworks** section

In this section, you will define “Frameworks” that will later be used by the packages. A framework definition in SmartSetup is just a group of supported **IDEs** and **Platforms**. You might define multiple frameworks for your packages, and each package can support multiple frameworks.

So, for example, you can have:

```yaml
Framework1:
  ide since: delphixe2
  ide until: delphi11

  platforms:  
    - win32intel

```

and

```yaml

Framework2:
  ide since: delphi12

  platforms:
    - win32intel
    - win64intel
    - win64xintel

```

And then a package might say it supports Framework1 or Framework2, or both. If it supports both, then it will support only win32 from Delphi XE2 to Delphi 11, and it will support win32/win64/win64x for Delphi 12 and newer.

We normally use the frameworks to specify stuff like “VCL”, “FMX”, “LCL”, etc. So your package might support FMX but not VCL or vice versa, or it might support both (if it is a core package). But there is no built-in knowledge in SmartSetup about that stuff. You can define any framework name you want, with any combination of IDEs and platforms you want.

{{#Note}}

It is unnecessary to include the line: “ide until”. If you don’t, SmartSetup will assume the Framework supports all IDEs since “ide since”. This way, you don’t need to change the file every time a new Delphi version comes out.

{{/Note}}

{{#Note}}

A framework can include *weak* dependencies. A *weak* dependency is a dependency that is only used if installed. With a normal dependency, if package A depends on B, and B isn’t available, you will get an error. With a weak dependency, if package B isn’t available, then Package A won’t be installed either. You can use weak dependencies to add extra functionality to your packages **only** if another package is already installed. 

For example, your product might get the ability to encrypt files, only if tms crypto pack is installed. If it isn’t, then the package in your product that provides the functionality will be skipped, as it has a weak dependency with crypto pack.

SmartSetup is smart enough that if you later install crypto pack, it will recompile your product automatically and install the package that had been skipped because crypto pack wasn’t there.

{{/Note}}

### **packages** section

Here you need to specify the packages that SmartSetup has to build and/or install. If your package is named `MyPackage.dproj` then you have to add an entry with the text `MyPackage`. Then, specify the frameworks that this package supports. For example, it might be a VCL-only package, and then only support Win32/64 and not other platforms like Linux. The names of frameworks you can use were defined in the previous section, but there are three additional always-available ones:

  * **design**: This is a design package.

  * **runtime**: This is a runtime package.

  * **exe**: This is an application, not a component.

### **package options** section.

You only need this section if you have packages that are not using the [Standard SmartSetup naming](#standard-smartsetup-naming).

Here, you can specify the naming for your packages if they are not “d11, d12, etc”, and also the LIBSUFFIX you are using if it is not the standard Delphi uses (280, 290, etc) There are also some options like automatically adding a LIBSUFFIX if it isn’t there, etc. Each property is documented in the [example tmsbuild.yaml](https://github.com/tmssoftware/smartsetup/blob/git-registry/tms/example-config/tmsbuild.yaml) but you can remove this section completely if you don’t need to adapt the packages.

You can find some examples of real-world usage for this section here:

   * [Different package naming and different LIBSUFFIX](https://github.com/tmssoftware/smartsetup-registry/blob/main/sglienke.spring4d/tmsbuild.yaml)

   * [A single package supporting all Delphi versions with LIBSUFFIX AUTO](https://github.com/tmssoftware/smartsetup-registry/blob/main/pyscripter.python4delphi/tmsbuild.yaml)

### **package definitions** section

This section applies only if the library you are adapting for SmartSetup doesn’t have packages at all. We recommend you ship packages with your bundle, because that way, users can also manually install the components by unzipping them, opening the packages and registering them. But if you prefer, you can auto-generate them, and that’s what this section is for.

Again, you can find the documentation for each property in the [example tmsbuild.yaml file](https://github.com/tmssoftware/smartsetup/blob/git-registry/tms/example-config/tmsbuild.yaml), but here you define some basic properties (name of the package, description, etc) and the files it will contain. All packages defined here must have been defined previously in the [packages section](#packages-section)

In the files section, you can define multiple “sources” for the files. In each source, you can specify a mask to include files, another to exclude files, and if you want to include recursively all files in children folders too. If recursively including files, you can also specify masks for including and excluding folders below the root folder.

You can find some real-world examples of libraries that don’t have packages here:

[Delphi TOML](https://github.com/tmssoftware/smartsetup-registry/blob/main/pyscripter.toml.delphi/tmsbuild.yaml)

[Delphi AST](https://github.com/tmssoftware/smartsetup-registry/blob/main/yankovsky.delphi.ast/tmsbuild.yaml)

{{#Note}}

Currently, SmartSetup supports generating packages for Delphi XE or newer. It will also generate one package by version before Delphi 11, and a “d11+” folder for Delphi11 and newer.

{{/Note}}

### **paths** section

By default, SmartSetup will automatically add all needed paths to Delphi when installing. But you might need to specify additional paths to be added to the library/browsing path that SmartSetup can’t figure out by itself. You can use this section to add those additional paths.

{{#Note}}

Try to add as little as possible here. The more stuff you add, the more crowded the library path for Delphi will be. Also, try not to add source files to the library path unless really necessary. SmartSetup can work with a lot of libraries, and if they all add their sources to the library path, compilation of projects from the IDE will become really slow.

If you need a path specifically for compiling, but there is no need to add it to the library path (for example, a path to find an include file), you can use the `build-only library paths` for that. Here is a real-world example of that case: [SynEdit](https://github.com/tmssoftware/smartsetup-registry/blob/main/turbopack.synedit/tmsbuild.yaml)

{{/Note}}

### **defines** section

This section works in tandem with the section “defines” in your [tms.config.yaml configuration file](https://github.com/tmssoftware/smartsetup/blob/git-registry/tms/example-config/tms.config.byproduct.yaml).

In the configuration file, the user can write a list of defines for your product to use when compiling. For example, he could write:

```yaml
   defines:
       - RTTI
       - UNICODE
```

To have your product compiled with both RTTI enabled and UNICODE support. In your own code, you would have to have something like this:

```delphi
{$IFDEF UNICODE}
 //Consume Unicode library
{$ENDIF}

```

When the user does a `tms build` or `tms install`, SmartSetup will automatically pass the defines RTTI and UNICODE to your library, so it will be compiled as the user expects. But, if you declare a `defines filename` in this section, the defines will also be saved to the file you specify, with the following contents:

```delphi
// This file was generated automatically by TMS Smart Setup.
// Do not modify it, as it will be overwritten every time you rebuild.
// To change the values below, modify tms.config.yaml and re-run tms build.

{$DEFINE RTTI}
{$DEFINE UNICODE}

```

You can then include this file in your sources, with `{$I <DefinesFileName>}. This is not strictly necessary for SmartSetup to work (it passes the defines in the command line anyway), but it will help your users if they want to compile your library manually from the IDE.

{{#Important}}

By default, SmartSetup has disabled the “modify sources” parameter in `tms.config.yaml`. This means that with a default configuration, SmartSetup won’t generate this file. It will only be generated if the user edits its configuration and allows SmartSetup to modify the sources.

{{/Important}}

Besides the `defines filename`, here you can specify which defines your user might specify when compiling your application. Currently, this isn’t used anywhere, but a GUI could read those values and present a list to the users so they can click in a checkbox “RTTI” for your library. It also works as a documentation: users who know might read your `tmsbuild.yaml` file and get a list of available defines they can use from here.

### **registry keys** section

This section allows you to add entries to the registry, should your product need them. Normally it should be empty, as SmartSetup will add all needed entries for registering the packages and library paths automatically. Only HKCU entries are allowed, for security, and also because SmartSetup runs without admin rights.

### **help** section

If your bundle includes a chm file, you can write its name here and SmartSetup will register the help inside Rad Studio. This way, users can press F1 while working in Delphi with your components and get help about them.

### **links** section

Use this section to create entries in the Start Menu. 

### **file links** section

Here you can create a hard link between two files inside your bundle. For security reasons, you can't link outside your bundle except, as a special case, the bpl folder where SmartSetup is building all bpls.

This section is used mostly if you have DLLs and want to make them available in the Windows PATH. SmartSetup, if set to register, adds its bpl folder to the PATH. But that path is outside your bundle, and you can't just ship a DLL linked to that folder. So, you can create a link to your DLL here.

For example, these are the links that FlexCel dll defines in its `tmsbuild.yaml`:

```yaml
file links:
  - link:
      file to link: Packages\dll\Win32\Release\FlexCelDyn.dll
      link to folder: #optional. If you don't specify it, it will link to the bpl folder.
      os: [windows] #can be any combination of windows, linux or mac (for example [linux,mac]). If empty, it will try to create the links in all supported Operating Systems.

  - link:
      file to link: Packages\dll\Win64\Release\FlexCelDyn64.dll
      link to folder: #optional. If you don't specify it, it will link to bpl folder.
      os: [windows] #can be any combination of windows, linux or mac (for example [linux,mac]). If empty it will try to create the links in all supported Operating Systems.
```

This will link both DLLs to the bpl folder, so they will be in the PATH.

### **other versions** section

This section is used by tms products to know if a product to install is also installed by an old, not SmartSetup, installer. If the registry key in this section exists, SmartSetup will refuse to run and tell you to uninstall the old product first. You can most likely delete this section for your own products.

### **dependencies** section

Here you define which product your product depends on. While SmartSetup builds in parallel, it guarantees that those products will be fully compiled before yours starts compiling, and their library paths will be passed to compile your product.

## Binary distributions

We designed SmartSetup so that it would be used for “source code” distributions, where the sources are compiled on the fly and then registered. This is the best way to install Delphi packages, because the dcus will be compiled in **your** machine, with the exact same version of Delphi that you will use to compile your apps.

But sometimes you might need to distribute binary packages. For example, in trials or components where you don’t want to make the source code available. Binary packages have the following characteristics:

* They can be faster to install. But note that this is not always the case: SmartSetup is quick to compile, and a binary distribution can be huge. Sometimes the time to download the bigger bundle and uncompress it might be more than the time to compile in place.

* They can be huge. Especially if you have packages for Linux, Android or iOS. So we recommend compressing them as [.tar.zstd](https://facebook.github.io/zstd/) instead of zip, using a high compression ratio. Most tools that can create zip files can also create .tar.zstd files.

* They have to be compiled to the exact Delphi version that the user is using. Even when in theory Delphi service packs, patches and hotfixes are binary compatible, they have issues plenty of times.

### Creating a binary distribution

SmartSetup always requires a “compiler”. A compiler takes the source files ( .pas, .res, etc) and generates binary files from them (.dcu, .bpl, etc) in a different folder. Everything in SmartSetup relies on a compiler being present. For example, it assumes that it can always delete the output folder when doing a new build, because the compiler will be able to regenerate those files from the sources.

This means that a binary distribution can’t just ship with its dcus and bpls in the output folder. SmartSetup is constantly deleting that folder. So what we have instead is the concept of a “Precompiled Compiler”. A precompiled compiler is just another type of “compiler”, the same as msbuild or dcc32, which happens to generate its binaries by linking the same binaries from a different place. Now SmartSetup can freely remove the output folder again, and when you run this precompiled compiler, it will regenerate them. You can even mix binary packages and source packages in the same distribution.

A precompiled compiler needs a project file, the same as the other compilers. MsBuild uses `.dproj`, dcc32 uses `.dpk`, and the precompiled compiler uses `.binproj` files. Binproj files are currently empty; they don’t have any valuable information.     

So, to create a binary bundle, you need to:

  1. Provide .binproj packages in the same place you would provide .dproj files. If your source package has a `MyPackage1.dproj` and `MyPackage2.dproj` in the folders `packages\d11` `and packages\d12`, then you need to provide two empty files: `MyPackage1.binproj` and `MyPackage2.binproj` in the same folders. 

  2. Provide the “sources” for the compiler. Those sources are the compiled dcus, bpls, etc which you want to have in the output folder, and they are by convention in the `\BinPackages` folder. For example, this is the structure of the TMS WebCore binary distribution:

```
BinPackages
  ├───d11
  │   └───Win32
  │       └───Release
  ├───d12
  │   ├───Win32
  │   │   └───Release
  │   └───Win64
  │       └───Release
  ├───dberlin
  │   └───Win32
  │       └───Release
  ├───drio
  │   └───Win32
  │       └───Release
  ├───dsydney
  │   └───Win32
  │       └───Release
  └───dtokyo
      └───Win32
          └───Release
```
Note how there are packages for Win64 and Win32 for Delphi 12, because Delphi 12 comes with a 64bit IDE. When you run a `tms build -full` command in the root folder, the compiler will first remove the output folder, then take the binaries in the `BinPackages` folder, and link them to the output folder again. If you are compiling for D12 only, and only win32, it will only link the packages in `\BinPackages\d12\Win32\Release` into `\packages\d12\Win32\Release`

{{#Note}}
The precompiled compiler creates hardlinks between the files in `BinPackages` and the output files, so there is no extra disk space needed. 
{{/Note}}

That is all that is required. If your bundle has .binproj files with the same name as the .dproj files that would be in a source distribution, and you place the binaries you want in the `BinPackages` folder, it will work just like any other distribution.

## Compiling applications

While SmartSetup is focused primarily on compiling and distributing packages, it can also be used to compile your own applications. 
{{#Note}}
Different from packages, where we only support Delphi, when compiling applications **we also support C++ Builder projects**.
{{/Note}}

SmartSetup builds **applications** very differently from **packages**. When compiling a package, SmartSetup does a lot of stuff under the hood, from changing whatever output path the package had to the standard, to copying the bpls to a path which is in the Windows Path, creating release and debug versions, and a huge list of etceteras. On the other hand, when it compiles an application, it just runs msbuild on it. It will keep whatever output path the application had, and won't do a lot of extra work. Just the basics to compile.

So what are the advantages of building your applications with SmartSetup instead of directly with MSBuild? While the advantages aren't that big as when compiling packages, there are a few reasons why you might prefer to compile your apps with SmartSetup:
  * **Dependency Management**: Your application can depend on other SmartSetup libraries, and it won't be compiled until all other libraries are. If you change a library, then your app will be automatically recompiled to reflect the changes.
  * **Parallel Compiling**: All your applications can be compiled at the same time, once the libraries they depend on are compiled.
  * **No need to install the libraries that your application requires**: If they are SmartSetup-enabled libraries, you don't need to install them in the Delphi IDE. You can set *skip register" to true in [tms.config.yaml](xref:SmartSetup.Configuration#basic-configuration) and your app will be compiled changing nothing in Delphi itself. This is very good for build servers, where you might not want to install libraries.
  * **One less tool to master**: You don't have to build your libraries using `tms build` and your app using `msbuild`. You can use the same tool for both.

You can find an example of an application compiled with SmartSetup here: https://github.com/tmssoftware/smartsetup-registry/blob/main/amelander.map2pdb/tmsbuild.yaml

## Supporting multiple Delphi versions with the same package

In the beginning (that's before Delphi 6), it wasn't possible to register packages with the same name in two different Delphi versions. If you had "MyPackage.bpl" installed in Delphi 4, you couldn't install another "MyPackage.bpl" in Delphi 5. That's because bpls go into the global Windows Path, and Delphi 5 would find the Delphi4 bpl and crash. So we had to ship packages like "MyPackageD4.bpl" and "MyPackageD5.bpl"

Then, Delphi6 added [{$LIBSUFFIX}](https://docwiki.embarcadero.com/RADStudio/en/Compiler_directives_for_libraries_or_shared_objects_%28Delphi%29). Users looked, and saw it was good. With this directive, you could have the same Package name, and, if you used a `60` libsuffix for Delphi 6, and `70` libsuffix for Delphi 7, you could have a single package named "MyPackage" for both Delphi 6 and 7. The generated packages would be `MyPackage60.bpl` and `Mypackage70.bpl` so they could coexist, but it was a single package with the same name for both. This made updating the Delphi versions easier, since now your projects would keep referencing the same package names, and it was unnecessary to change your projects when upgrading. Still, while they had the same name, you needed different files for them. The packages for Delphi XE would have `{$LIBSUFFIX 150}` inside, and the packages for Delphi XE2 would have `{$LIBSUFFIX 160}` inside.

Now, coming closer in time, Delphi 10.4 introduced a new `{$LIBSUFIX AUTO}`. But it was buggy on release, so we will consider Delphi 11 the first Delphi version with a working `{$LIBSUFIX AUTO}`

Finally, you could ship a single package and use it in Delphi 11 and Delphi 12, and even unreleased versions, and, barring breaking changes in the dprojs, have them work. Still, a minor problem remained. If you just shipped:

```shell
packages\D11+\MyPackage.dproj
```
instead of
```shell
packages\D11\MyPackage.dproj
packages\D12\MyPackage.dproj
```

It would not be possible to compile MyPackage for Delphi 11 and Delphi 12 at the same time. When you compiled `packages\D11+\MyPackage.dproj` with Delphi 11, the dcus would go to `packages\D11+\Win32\Release`. If you now compiled it with Delphi 12, the dcus would go to the exact same folder, overwriting the Delphi 11 dcus and making Delphi 11 to stop working. While with our "classical" approach of a different folder per Delphi version, it would have worked just fine. 

But there is a little not-that-much known property that can come to the rescue. When setting our output folders, we used to set them to `$(Platform)\$(Config)`. If a built-in variable existed for the Delphi version, the last piece of the puzzle would fall in place, allowing us to finally ship a single package that supports multiple versions. 

Enter `$(ProductVersion)`. This variable will output `22.0` for Delphi 11, and `23.0` for Delphi 12.
So, if we set the output paths of our packages to `$(ProductVersion)\$(Platform)\$(Config)` instead of `$(Platform)\$(Config)` as we used to do, when you compile `packages\D11+\MyPackage.dproj` with Delphi 11, dcus will go to `packages\D11+\22.0\Win32\Release`. When we compile them with Delphi 12, they will go to `packages\D11+\23.0\Win32\Release`. No crash.

SmartSetup will automatically output the dcus to `$(ProductVersion)\$(Platform)\$(Config)` if it detects that a single package is designed to be compiled with more than one Delphi version (either because it is inside a `D11+` folder with standard naming, or because you defined the package to support `D11+` with custom naming). There is nothing you need to do for it to work that way. Still, if the user compiles your packages manually, they will go to wherever the output path is set. **So we strongly suggest that you set all output paths in your packages to `$(ProductVersion)\$(Platform)\$(Config)`**

{{#Note}}
At tms, we believe the advantages of shipping a single package instead of thousands of them are just too good to ignore. So, we plan to move our products to support the "D11+" notation as time allows. Having a single package for all Delphi versions after D11 allows us to:
  * Avoid duplicated information. Now, there is a single package that is the "source of truth" for everything. If you change it, it will change for all Delphi versions.
  * It will allow us to ship packages that will keep installing in newer Delphi versions that weren't released at the time the package shipped. If you have products with a D11+ folder, you will be able to compile them with Delphi_NewVersion as soon as Delphi_NewVersion is released. You won't need to update the version of your package, only to compile in a newer Delphi version.
{{/Note}}

## Testing your package

By now, you have structured the packages the way you want them and have created a tmsbuild.yaml file. So, you need to test that it all works. To do it, just open a command line prompt, and type:

```shell
cd <folder_where_your_bundle_is>
tms build
```

If you are (very) lucky, it might work on the first try. But the most common case is that something will fail. You can then type:

```shell
tms log-view
```

This will open a browser showing a detailed log of what happened. Errors will be highlighted in red. 
You can keep the browser open and just refresh it every time you try a new `tms build`

Once everything is looking good, it is time to go to the next step: [Publishing your bundle](xref:SmartSetup.PublishingBundles)
