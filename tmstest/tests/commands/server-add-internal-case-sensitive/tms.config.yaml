# general options that are not "per product".
tms smart setup options:

  # 0 means use the optimum for the cores in the machine (default). 1 means single core. 2 two cores and so on.
  build cores: 0

  # installs the component in an alternate place so you can have different components installed in the same Delphi.
  # see https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9290131/starting-delphi-with-an-alternate-registry-key
  alternate registry key: 

  # prevents the machine from going to sleep while smart setup is running. Default is true.
  # note that for this setting to work, "Allow applications to prevent automatic sleep (plugged in)" must be set
  # to Enabled in the Group Policy Settings. See https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys/issues/12326#issuecomment-1304934080
  prevent sleep: true

  # smart setup will delete the oldest downloaded versions when they reach this count. If you
  # for example set this value to 4, smart setup will keep the last 4 versions of each product, and 
  # versions older than that will be deleted forever. 
  # A value of 0 means to delete all products after unzipped, including the current versions.
  # A value of -1 means to keep all versions and never delete any.
  versions to keep: -1

  # the default behavior of smart setup is to skip Delphi versions and platforms that are not installed.
  # this is normally what you want, so you don't have to manually specify in this file which platforms and Delphi versions
  # to compile. You just leave it to compile all, and smart setup will skip what is not installed.
  # but when running smart setup from a CI or other automated system, you might want to configure exactly what
  # platforms and Delphi IDEs you want to build, and have smart setup return an error code instead of just skipping them.
  # if you set this property true, smart setup will return an error value if it skips any Delphi version or platform.
  error if skipped: false
    
  
  # add to this list the products you don't want to be built/installed
  excluded products:
    #- tms.example1
    #- tms.example2

  # if you add at least one item in "included products", then only those will be built/installed.
  # if there are none, all products will be processed.
  included products:
    #- tms.example1
    #- tms.example2

  # By default, tms looks for tmsbuild.yaml in folders under the folder where this file is. But you can add additional
  # root folders here, so tms also looks for tmsbuild.yaml files in those folders.
  # All configuration folders (.tmsbuild, Temp, etc) are still under the main root folder, nothing will
  # be generated under the additional folders. This is useful if you want to use tms to build your own code.
  # The folders you add here must be in the same drive as the main root folder.
  additional products folders:
    #- c:\MyProducts   #All folders containing tmsbuild.yaml files inside c:\MyProducts will be added to the build.
    #- ..\..\Other products  #Try to use relative folders if possible.

  # Specify which servers SmartSetup will connect to.
  # When creating your own server, you also need to specify "protocol" (can be local, api, github)
  # And the "url" where the server is.
  servers:
    local:
      enabled: true

    community:
      enabled: false

    tms:
      enabled: true

  git:
    # Location where to find git.exe. If not specified, smart setup will search for the first git.exe available in the OS PATH.
    #git location: c:\git\git.exe

    # Here you can specify extra parameters for the git clone call. If not specified, smart setup will do a plain clone.
    #clone command: clone

    # Command for git pull
    #pull command: pull

    # Command for a shallow clone that will be used to get a single file.
    #shallow clone command: clone --depth 1 --filter=blob:none --sparse

  svn:
    # Location where to find svn.exe. If not specified, smart setup will search for the first git.exe available in the OS PATH.
    #svn location: C:\fpc\fpcbootstrap\svn\bin\svn.exe

    # Here you can specify extra parameters for the svn checkout call. If not specified, smart setup will do a plain checkout.
    #checkout command: checkout

    # Command for svn update
    #update command: update

    # Command for svn export
    #export command: export

  # To enable megafolders, you need to be in dev-mode in Win10+. 
  # Megafolders use symlinks, so you need to be able to create them without admin rights.
  dcu megafolders:
    #- none: 'tms.flexcel.vcl'   # FlexCel VCL has over 5000 units, it is not worth putting it into a megafolder
    #- tms: 'tms.*'   # All other products matching tms.* except FlexCel go to the tms folder
    #- none: 'biglib.*' # All "none" entries won't use megafolders. Use none for big libraries.
    #- other: '*' #all products that didn't match our previous rules go into other.

# the settings in this section apply to all products. You might apply different settings to specific products below
configuration for all products:
  options:
    # can be info, messages or errors
    verbosity: info

    # if true the components will be compiled but not registered in the IDE.
    # Also the Windows PATH won't be modified when this setting is true.
    # You can use "true" or "false" here to skip all or none, and also an array like "[All, Packages, StartMenu, Help, WindowsPath, WebCore, Registry, FileLinks]"
    # to be more specific about what you want to skip. For example: skip register: [StartMenu, Help] would skip registering the start menu and the help, but not the others. 
    # When specifically skipping parts, you might want to use negatives, like [All, -StartMenu, -Help] to skip all but start menu and help.
    skip register: false

    # if true, smart setup will output the commands it wants to execute, but not execute anything
    dry run: false

  # specify the IDEs you want to built for and install to.
  # if this option is omitted, it will try to build for all Delphi versions.
  # smart setup will anyway avoid installing to a Delphi version if it is not installed in the machine.

    use symlinks: false
    
    # In order to build the projects, we copy them into a "parallel" temporary folder that is automatically deleted once the build is done.

    keep parallel folders: false
    
    # Smart setup by default won't modify any file in the sources folder.
    # If you set this to true, it will modify and adapt files in the sources so when you compile them manually they behave similar to when you use Smart setup.
    modify sources: false

    # When a product fails, by default Smart Setup tries to recompile all the packages in the product again.
    # This is done for safety, and because building the full product is normally fast enough.
    # If you enable partial builds, Smart setup will try to compile only those packages that were actually modified and those that depend on it.
    partial builds: false

    # if enabled, adds the source code paths to Delphi library path
    # do not enable this option unless you really need it
    add source code to library path: false

  # for Lazarus, the path where lazbuild.exe is located  
  # for Delphi, the path where bin\rsvars.bat is located.
  # smart setup will find paths to Delphi automatically from registry keys,
  # so this option is not needed unless you have a build machine you didn't install Delphi to,
  # or you want to compile lazarus packages.
  compiler paths:
