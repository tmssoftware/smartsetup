# General options that are not 'per product'.
tms smart setup options:

  # 0 means use the optimum for the cores in the machine (default). 1 means single core. 2 two cores and so on.
  build cores: 0

  # installs the component in an alternate place so you can have different components installed in the same Delphi.
  # see https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9290131/starting-delphi-with-an-alternate-registry-key
  alternate registry key:

  # prevents the machine from going to sleep while smart setup is running. Default is true.
  # note that for this setting to work, "Allow applications to prevent automatic sleep (plugged in)" must be set
  # to Enabled in the Group Policy Settings. See https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys/issues/12326#issuecomment-1304934080
  prevent sleep: true

  # smart setup will delete the oldest downloaded versions when they reach this count. If you
  # for example set this value to 4, smart setup will keep the last 4 versions of each product, and
  # versions older than that will be deleted forever.
  # A value of 0 means to delete all products after unzipped, including the current versions.
  # A value of -1 means to keep all versions and never delete any.
  versions to keep: -1

  # The default behavior of smart setup is to skip Delphi versions and platforms that are not installed.
  # this is normally what you want, so you don't have to manually specify in this file which platforms and Delphi versions
  # to compile. You just leave it to compile all, and smart setup will skip what is not installed.
  # but when running smart setup from a CI or other automated system, you might want to configure exactly what
  # platforms and Delphi IDEs you want to build, and have smart setup return an error code instead of just skipping them.
  # if you set this property true, smart setup will return an error value if it skips any Delphi version or platform.
  error if skipped: false

  # add to this list the products you don't want to be built/installed
  excluded products:

  # add to this list the products you want to be built/installed. If this list is empty, all products will be built/installed.
  included products:

  # By default, tms looks for tmsbuild.yaml in folders under the folder where this file is. But you can add additional
  # root folders here, so tms also looks for tmsbuild.yaml files in those folders.
  # All configuration folders (.tmsbuild, Temp, etc) are still under the main root folder, nothing will
  # be generated under the additional folders. This is useful if you want to use tms to build your own sources.
  # The folders you add here must be in the same drive as the main root folder.
  additional products folders:
    #- c:\MyProducts   #All folders containing tmsbuild.yaml files inside c:\MyProducts will be added to the build.
    #- ..\..\Other products  #Try to use relative folders if possible.

  # Specify which servers SmartSetup will connect to.
  # When creating your own server, you also need to specify "type" (can be api, zipfile)
  # And the "url" where the server is.

    # if true the components will be compiled but not registered in the IDE.
    # Also the Windows PATH won't be modified when this setting is true.
    # You can use "true" or "false" here to skip all or none, and also an array like "[All, Packages, StartMenu, Help, WindowsPath, WebCore, Registry, FileLinks]" to be more specific about what you want to skip.
    # For example: skip register: [StartMenu, Help] would skip registering the start menu and the help, but not the others.
    # When specifically skipping parts, you might want to use negatives, like [All, -StartMenu, -Help] to skip all but start menu and help.

  # Compilation options for the product.
  compilation options:

    # Whether to build debug DCUs. Debug DCUs are useful for stepping into the component code, but they take more time to compile and double the used disk space.
    debug dcus: true

    # Packages can have pre/post build events, which can be a security risk, so we disable them by default.
    # If you need to enable them for some project, create a `configuration for project` section and enable them for that project.
    run build events: false

    # List of compiler defines to use for compiling. The defines here are added to the ones already defined before. To remove a define that is normally defined, set it to false, like for example " - DEBUG: false".
    defines:
      #- RTTI
      #- USE_UNICODE

  # for internal tmsbuild development. do not change.
  advanced options:

    # By setting this to true, smart setup will use symlinks instead of hard links. Symlinks require admin rights, unless your PC is in "dev mode".
    # See https://blogs.windows.com/windowsdeveloper/2016/12/02/symlinks-windows-10/
    use symlinks: false

    # In order to build the projects, we copy them into a "parallel" temporary folder that is automatically deleted once the build is done.
    # If you set this to true, the temporary parallel folders won't be deleted and you can examine what they have.
    keep parallel folders: false

    # Smart setup by default won't modify any file in the sources folder.
    # If you set this to true, it will modify and adapt files in the sources so when you compile them manually they behave similar to when you use Smart setup.
    modify sources: false

    # When a product fails, by default Smart Setup tries to recompile all the packages in the product again.
    # This is done for safety, and because building the full product is normally fast enough.
    # If you enable partial builds, Smart setup will try to compile only those packages that were actually modified and those that depend on it. **This feature is highly experimental and not likely to work well**
    partial builds: false

    # if enabled, adds the source code paths to Delphi library path
    # do not enable this option unless you really need it.
    add source code to library path: false

  # for Lazarus, the path where lazbuild.exe is located
  # for Delphi, the path where bin\rsvars.bat is located.
  # smart setup will find paths to Delphi automatically from registry keys,
  # so this option is not needed unless you have a build machine you didn't install Delphi to,
  # or you want to compile lazarus packages.
  compiler paths:
    lazarus: #c:\fpc\lazarus
    delphi13: #c:\dev\Embarcadero\Studio\37.0
